# Selformer Multimodal Approach

Welcome to the **Selformer Multimodal Approach** repository! This repository contains all the *main* work we have done so far. Please note that the project is still a work in progress.

## Overview

### Data Processing
You can find all the work related to data processing in the `data` folder. It contains the steps we have taken to preprocess and prepare the data for the multimodal approach.

### Current Model
We are actively working on the model to handle preprocessing for the multimodal inputs, including SELFIES notations, text descriptions, knowledge graphs, and graph representations.
